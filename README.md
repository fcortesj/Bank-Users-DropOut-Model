1. To setup the project you need first to open the notebook named final_project_implementation

2. Once you have the notebook opened you need to add the main data source from /utils/data/run-1621650847915-part-r-00000 and the statistic functions used in some models /utils/functions/funciones_Estadisticas.py

3. Finally you can run the project using a local environment (jupyter) or a cloud environment (Google Collab or AWS SageMaker)
